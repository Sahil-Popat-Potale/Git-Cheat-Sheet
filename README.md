## üîÑ Basic Workflow

### **Check the Status of Your Repository**
```bash
git status
```
**How it works**: This command shows the current status of your working directory and staging area, indicating which files have been modified, added, or deleted.

### **Add Files to the Staging Area**
```bash
# Add a specific file
git add filename.txt

# Add all changes
git add .
```
**How it works**: The `git add` command moves your changes from the working directory to the staging area, preparing them to be committed.

### **Commit Changes**
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
**How it works**: This command saves your changes from the staging area to the repository with a descriptive message. It creates a new commit in the project's history.

### **Push Changes to the Remote Repository**
```bash
git push origin main
```
**How it works**: The `git push` command uploads your commits to a remote repository, allowing others to access your changes.

### **Pull Changes from the Remote Repository**
```bash
git pull origin main
```
**How it works**: This command fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

## üå≥ Branching

### **List All Branches**
```bash
git branch
```
**How it works**: This command lists all branches in your repository, showing which one is currently active.

### **Create a New Branch**
```bash
git branch new-branch
```
**How it works**: This command creates a new branch, allowing you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

### **Switch to a Branch**
```bash
git checkout branch-name
```
**How it works**: The `git checkout` command allows you to switch between branches in your repository.

### **Create and Switch to a New Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```
**How it works**: This command creates a new branch and immediately switches to it, combining the `git branch` and `git checkout` commands.

### **Merge a Branch into the Current Branch**
```bash
git merge branch-name
```
**How it works**: The `git merge` command integrates changes from one branch into the current branch, combining the work done on different branches.

### **Delete a Branch**
```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```
**How it works**: This command deletes a branch that you no longer need, helping to keep your repository clean and organized.

## üåê Remote Repositories

### **Add a Remote Repository**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
**How it works**: This command adds a remote repository, allowing you to push and pull changes to and from that remote source.

### **View All Remote Repositories**
```bash
git remote -v
```
**How it works**: This command displays the URLs of all remote repositories linked to your local repository, along with their fetch and push details.

### **Remove a Remote Repository**
```bash
git remote remove origin
```
**How it works**: The `git remote remove` command disconnects a remote repository from your local repository.

## üïí Logs and History

### **View the Commit History**
```bash

### **View a Simplified Commit History**
```bash
git log --oneline
```
**How it works**: This command displays a condensed version of your commit history, showing only the commit hashes and messages.

### **Show Differences Between Commits or Branches**
```bash
# Show differences between working directory and staging area
git diff

# Show differences between two branches
git diff branch1 branch2
```
**How it works**: The `git diff` command shows the differences between two commits, branches, or your working directory and the staging area, helping you see what has changed.

---

## üíæ Stashing

### **Stash Changes**
```bash
git stash
```
**How it works**: This command temporarily saves your uncommitted changes in a "stash," allowing you to work on something else without losing your progress.

### **Undo a Commit and Keep Changes**
```bash
git reset --soft commit_hash
```
**How it works**: The `git reset --soft` command moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit but keeps all your changes in the staging area.

### **Undo a Commit and Remove Changes**
```bash
git reset --hard commit_hash
```
**How it works**: The `git reset --hard` command moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit and removes all changes in your working directory and staging area.

### **Restore a Specific File**
```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt
```
**How it works**: This command restores a specific file from the last commit, discarding any changes made to it since then.

---

## üóëÔ∏è Removing Files

### **Remove a File and Stage the Deletion**
```bash
git rm filename.txt
```
**How it works**: The `git rm` command deletes a file from your working directory and stages the deletion for the next commit.

### **Remove a File from Staging but Keep It Locally**
```bash
git rm --cached filename.txt
```
**How it works**: This command removes a file from the staging area but keeps it in your working directory, effectively untracking it without deleting it.

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging

### **Create a Lightweight Tag**
```bash
git tag tag-name
```
**How it works**: The `git tag` command marks a specific commit with a lightweight tag, which is just a pointer to that commit.

### **Create an Annotated Tag**
```bash
git tag -a tag-name -m "Tag message"
```
**How it works**: This command creates an annotated tag, which includes a message and is stored as a full object in the Git database.

### **Push Tags to the Remote Repository**
```bash
git push origin tag-name
``}
**How it works**: The `git push` command can also be used to push tags to a remote repository, making them available to others.

## üîÑ Fetching and Rebasing

### **Fetch Changes from a Remote Repository**
```bash
git fetch origin
``}
**How it works**: The `git fetch` command downloads objects and refs from another repository, updating your remote-tracking branches.

### **Reapply Commits on Top of Another Base Tip**
```bash
git rebase branch-name
``}
**How it works**: The `git rebase` command replays commits from one branch onto another, effectively changing the base of your branch.

### **Abort a Rebase in Progress**
```bash
git rebase --abort
