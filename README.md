Here are the remaining Git commands organized into proper categories and formatted to continue from the previous cheat sheet:

---

## üñºÔ∏è Tagging and Version Control

### **Delete a Tag**
```bash
git tag -d tag-name
```
**How it works**: This command deletes a tag locally from your repository. The tag will still exist on the remote until you delete it there as well.

### **Push All Tags to the Remote Repository**
```bash
git push origin --tags
```
**How it works**: The `git push --tags` command pushes all local tags to the remote repository, making them available to everyone.

### **Delete a Tag from the Remote Repository**
```bash
git push origin --delete tag tag-name
```
**How it works**: This command removes a tag from the remote repository so that it is no longer available to others.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Up

### **Remove Untracked Files**
```bash
git clean -f
```
**How it works**: The `git clean` command removes untracked files from the working directory, helping you clean up unnecessary files. Use `-f` to force the deletion.

### **Dry Run to See What Would Be Removed**
```bash
git clean -n
```
**How it works**: This command performs a dry run, showing you which untracked files would be deleted without actually deleting them.

---

## üîÄ Rewriting History

### **Amend the Last Commit**
```bash
git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"
```
**How it works**: The `git commit --amend` command allows you to modify the most recent commit. You can change the commit message or add new changes.

### **Rebase Interactively**
```bash
git rebase -i commit_hash
```
**How it works**: This command opens an interactive rebase session, where you can modify, combine, or delete previous commits.

---

## üïπÔ∏è Cherry-Picking

### **Apply a Specific Commit to the Current Branch**
```bash
git cherry-pick commit_hash
```
**How it works**: The `git cherry-pick` command allows you to apply changes from a specific commit on one branch to another branch.

---

## üö® Conflict Resolution

### **Show Conflicts After a Merge**
```bash
git status
```
**How it works**: After a merge conflict, running `git status` will show the files that have conflicts. You can then manually resolve them.

### **Mark Conflicts as Resolved**
```bash
git add filename.txt
```
**How it works**: After resolving conflicts in a file, add the file to the staging area with `git add` to mark it as resolved.

### **Continue After Resolving Conflicts**
```bash
git merge --continue
```
**How it works**: This command continues the merge process after you've resolved any conflicts.

### **Abort a Merge**
```bash
git merge --abort
```
**How it works**: This command aborts a merge in progress and returns the repository to its previous state before the merge started.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Workflows

### **Squash Commits**
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```
**How it works**: The `git rebase -i` command lets you combine several commits into one. Replace `n` with the number of commits you'd like to squash.

### **Bisect to Find Buggy Commits**
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good commit_hash
```
**How it works**: The `git bisect` command performs a binary search to find which commit introduced a bug. Mark the bad and good commits, and Git will help you locate the culprit.

---

## üîí Security and Maintenance

### **Sign a Commit**
```bash
git commit -S -m "Signed commit message"
```
**How it works**: This command signs your commits with a GPG key, ensuring their authenticity and integrity.

### **Verify Signed Commits**
```bash
git log --show-signature
```
**How it works**: This command checks the signatures of past commits, confirming whether they were signed and valid.

---

## üìä Git Aliases

### **Create a Git Alias**
```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
```
**How it works**: The `git config` command lets you create shortcuts for frequently used Git commands. Here, `git co` becomes shorthand for `git checkout`.

### **List All Aliases**
```bash
git config --get-regexp alias
```
**How it works**: This command lists all your Git aliases, showing you the shortcuts you've set up for quicker workflows.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Submodules

### **Add a Submodule**
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
**How it works**: The `git submodule add` command includes another Git repository as a submodule within your project, allowing you to track it as a separate module.

### **Initialize Submodules**
```bash
git submodule init
```
**How it works**: This command initializes all submodules in your project after they have been cloned.

### **Update Submodules**
```bash
git submodule update
```
**How it works**: The `git submodule update` command updates all submodules to their latest commits, ensuring they are in sync with the parent project.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Hooks

### **Create a Pre-Commit Hook**
```bash
# Navigate to .git/hooks/ directory
cd .git/hooks/

# Create a new pre-commit hook
touch pre-commit
```
**How it works**: This command creates a pre-commit hook script in the `.git/hooks/` directory. Pre-commit hooks run before each commit to check code quality or perform other tasks.
